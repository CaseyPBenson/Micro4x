Micro4x

3 terrain types per hex:
Impassible Terrain
Resource Rich
Not Defensible
Semi-Defensible
Very Defensible
Hazardous Terrain

One side has 1x terrain, other side has 3x? For a simpler/faster/lower player count game

4x
Explore - ?
Expand - Build Cities
Exploit - Gain Resources
Exterminate - Combat

Explore is the difficult one to define in a microgame.
-Instead of exploring the hexes, each region has a special exploration card associated with it (adds new components, but a deck of ~20 cards shouldn't be a huge ask)

Expand
-Cities built on the spaces between regions like catan?

Exploit:
-Only one resource for simplicity? Maybe multiuse resources of some sort. Cities are soldiers are resources, depending on where they are in the game. Provides an elegant conversion, too - 1 resouce becomes 1 troop (move from supply to board), 1 troop becomes 1 city (moves from region to space between regions)

Exterminate:
-Combat resolution like Imperial: units trade 1:1
-Combat resolution like Kemet: strength=number of units, plus modifiers from hand of cards (ties in to exploration sort of if the cards come from that)
